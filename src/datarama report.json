Most notably, former chairman  Lin Song  ( \u5b8b\u6797 ),also known as Charley Song, was  sentenced  to 14 years in prison in June 2017.CRH  and  several  CR  Group  subsidiaries  have  implemented  management  reshuffles  in  recentyears. While there is no indication that the personnel changes were non-routine or directly relatedto the above-mentioned investigations, they might potentially signal or even result in organisationalinstability within CR Group.From  2016  to  2017,  CR  Group  was  also  involved  in  a  high  profile  corporate  tussle  over  theownership  of  Chinese  property  developer   China  Vanke  Co  Ltd   ( \u4e07\u79d1\u4f01 \u4e1a \u80a1\u4efd\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8 ,  \u2018ChinaVanke\u2019).  Particularly,  CR  Group  was  accused  of  supporting  a  hostile  takeover  attempt  of  ChinaVanke by Chinese property and financial services conglomerate  Baoneng Group  ( \u5b9d \u80fd\u96c6 \u56e2 ). CRGroup\u2019s alleged ties with Baoneng Group warrants further scrutiny as the latter has faced punitivesanctions  over providing \u2018fake materials\u2019 and violating regulatory laws.Extensive  public  domain   research   identified  allegations  that  China\u2019s  Central  Commission  forDiscipline  Inspection  ( \u4e2d \u56fd \u5171 \u4ea7 \u515a\u4e2d\u592e \u7eaa \u5f8b \u68c0 \u67e5\u59d4 \u5458\u4f1a ,  \u2018CCDI\u2019)  had  placed  CRH\u2019s  chief  financialofficer  Ruge Li  ( \u674e\u6c5d\u9769 , \u2018Li\u2019) under investigations for undisclosed reasons in 2012.Additional  research  indicates that Li allegedly holds a close relationship with  Zhenya Liu  ( \u5218 \u632f \u4e9a ),the former chairman of state-owned electric utility company  State Grid Corporation of China  ( \u56fd \u5bb6\u7535 \u7f51\u516c\u53f8 ) from May 2013 to May 2016. This connection is potentially problematic as Liu was thetarget  of  a  state-led   accountability  audit   in  May  2014  following  accusations  of  financialmismanagement  and  corruption.  Liu  is  also   reportedly   a  proteg\u00e9  of   Qinghong  Zeng   ( \u66fe \u6df8 \u7ea2 ),China\u2019s  former  vice  president  who  has  reportedly  been  placed  under  investigations  and  housearrest amid China\u2019s ongoing anti-corruption campaignIn March 2015, China\u2019s CCDI issued a  \u2018serious warning\u2019  to Li and a colleague for having a lavishmeal which cost CNY 22,500 (USD 3,600). Both men were ordered to pay for the meal for wastingublic funds.Datarama also identified an unverified  report  that CRH\u2019s vice general manager  Lang Chen  ( \u9648 \u6717 ) isinvolved in an extramarital affair with an unidentified woman surnamed \u2018Wu\u2019 ( \u6b66 ). This connection isotentially  problematic  amid  the  Chinese  government\u2019s   tough  stance   on  \u2018adultery\u2019  and  \u2018moralcorruption\u2019 of its officials and public servants.",

    "6": "Extensive public domain  research  indicates that CRH and CR Group originated as Liow & Co ( \u806f\u5408\u884c ),which was established in Hong Kong in 1938 by Chinese communist revolutionary Lianan Yang ( \u6768 \u5ec9\u5b89 ,\u2018Yang\u2019), also known as Bangli Qing ( \u79e6\u90a6 \u793c ) and Lin Yang ( \u6768 \u7433 ), to collect money, military supplies andmedicines to  support  anti-Japanese war  efforts  during the  Second Sino-Japanese  War  (1937-1945). Inaddition to Yang, former Chinese premier Enlai Zhou ( \u5468\u6069 \u6765 ) and communist party leader Yun Chen ( \u9648\u4e91 ) also played key roles in forming the company as well as leading its resistance activities during the war,according to  information  from CR Group\u2019s corporate website.  Following the conclusion of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Liow & Co was restructured, expanded andrenamed  China  Resources  Company  ( \u83ef\u6f64\u516c\u53f8 )  in  1948.  The  company  also  pivoted  its  businessoperations to general trading activities focused on consumer and commercial products such as food andcrude oil. In 1952, ownership of China Resources Company was transferred from the General Office of theChinese Communist Party ( \u4e2d\u5171\u4e2d\u592e \u529e \u516c \u5385 ) to the state\u2019s Central Trade Department ( \u4e2d\u592e \u8d27 \u6613\u90e8 ), nowknown as the Ministry of Commerce ( \u4e2d \u534e \u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c \u56fd \u5546 \u52a1 \u90e8 ).According to  information  from CR Group\u2019s corporate website, China Resources Company then divertedfrom general trading activities and focused on the retail, real estate, power and infrastructure industries inthe  1980s.  In  1983,  China  Resources  Company  underwent  another  major  corporate  restructure,  whichinstituted an organisational structure that linked the company and its business affiliates via a network ofequity holdings. China Resources Company was also reorganised to become CRH.In 2003, CRH was placed under the direct administration of China\u2019s State-owned Assets Supervision andAdministration ( \u56fd\u52a1 \u9662 \u56fd \u6709 \u8d44\u4ea7\u76d1 \u7763\u7ba1\u7406\u59d4 \u5458\u4f1a , \u2018SASAC\u2019), making it one of China\u2019s 96  key state-ownedenterprises  ( \u4e2d\u592e\u4f01 \u4e1a ) that are controlled by the central government.Since late 2013, several senior CR Group executives have been placed under  investigations  for corruptionand  graft  (see  \u2018Negative  Exposure\u2019  section  below).  The  conglomerate  has  also  overhauled  its  seniormanagement  team  and  renamed  several  constituent  companies  in  recent  years.  For  instance,  mainholding company CRNC was renamed CRCL in December 2017.

A July 2016  article  by HongKong English-language mainstream newspaper South China Morning Post, for instance, describes Fu as a\u2018low-key chief\u2019 who seldom granted interviews to mainland or international media during his time at ChinaMerchants Group.

Particularly, publicly-available   information   indicates  that  Liu  was  the  target  of  a  state-led  accountability  audit  in  May  2014following accusations  of  financial mismanagement  and  corruption. According  to a  June  2015   article   byindependent and anti-establishment multi-language newspaper The Epoch Times ( \u5927\u7d00\u5143 ), he is also aknown  proteg\u00e9  of   Qinghong  Zeng   ( \u66fe \u6df8 \u7ea2 ,  \u2018Zeng\u2019),  China\u2019s  former  vice  president  from  March  2003  toMarch 2008. The same article further notes that Zeng has been placed under investigations and housearrest  amid  China\u2019s  ongoing  anti-corruption  campaign.  It  also  claims  that  Liu  had  facilitated  thecontroversial 2006 sale of state-owned energy and real estate company  Shandong Luneng Group  ( \u5c71 \u4e1c\u9c81\u80fd\u96c6 \u56e2 )  to  Zeng\u2019s  son,   Wei  Zeng   ( \u66fe \u4f1f ),  for  USD  600  million,  a  price  that  was  severely  below  thecompany\u2019s then-estimated value of USD 17.7 billion.In addition to his potentially problematic connection with Liu and, by extension,  Zeng, extensive publicdomain  research  also indicates that China\u2019s CCDI had issued \u2018serious warnings\u2019 ( \u4e25 \u91cd\u8b66\u544a \u5904 \u5206 ) to Li andhis former SGCC colleague  Peng Xu  ( \u5f90 \u9e4f ) in March 2015 for having a lavish meal with representativesfrom  SGCC  subsidiary   State  Grid  Shanghai  Municipal  Electric  Power  Co  Ltd   ( \u56fd \u7f51\u4e0a\u6d77\u5e02 \u7535 \u529b\u516c\u53f8 ,\u2018Shanghai Electric\u2019) which cost CNY 22,500 (USD 3,600). While  reports  indicate that Shanghai Electrichad footed the bill, Li and Xu were ordered to pay for the meal for wasting public funds.In view of the information presented above, further investigation is necessary to ascertain the veracity ofMingjing Magazine\u2019s uncorroborated claims, and determine whether Li has been involved in any significantreputational  issues  of  concern  such  as  corruption,  money-laundering,  fraud  or  other  forms  ofmalfeasance.

In addition to his appointment as one of CRH\u2019s vice general managers, Chen also served asthe  chairman  of   China  Resources  Enterprise  Ltd   ( \u83ef\u6f64\u5275\u696d\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8 )  and   China  Resources  Beer(Holdings) Co Ltd  ( \u83ef\u6f64\u5564\u9152\uff08\u63a7\u80a1\uff09\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8 ) as at October 2018.Chen  joined  CRH  in  1989,  and  had  previously  served  as  vice  chairman  and  chief  executive  officer  ofChina Resources Gas Group Ltd  ( \u83ef\u6f64\u71c3\u6c23\u63a7\u80a1\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8 ), formerly known as China Resources Logic Ltd( \u83ef\u6f64\u52f5\u81f4\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8 ), from October 2001 to January 2003. Extensive public domain research indicates that Chen maintains a moderate public profile that is generallyrofessional in nature and neutral in tone. Recent media  reports  featuring him have largely focused onCRH\u2019s  business  activities.  Datarama,  however,  identified  a  June  2017   article  by  independent Chinese-language  news  agency  360  News  Network  (360 \u6d88\u606f\u7f51 )  stating  that  Chen  had  a  mistress  and  wasfinancially supporting her. According to the article, insiders with close knowledge of the matter stated thatChen first became acquainted with an unidentified woman surnamed \u2018Wu\u2019 ( \u6b66 ) when she was 19 years oldand had been providing her with financial assistance for over ten years. Particularly, the article notes thatChen had funded Wu\u2019s education in the United States, provided the initial capital for her chain of beautysalons, and used his personal connections to help her establish a jewelry business. Chen also allegedlybought Wu several cars and property in Shanghai. The article concludes by stating that Chen, as a seniorexecutive of a key state-owned enterprise, had severely violated the Communist Party\u2019s disciplinary codeand affected its moral standing by having an extramarital affair. Datarama notes that the article receivedsignificant  media  attention  and  was  re-published  on  several  other  independent  Chinese   news  sitesincluding Dongying News ( \u4e1c\u8425\u8d44\u8baf \u7f51 ) and cqol ( \u91cd \u5e86 \u5728 \u7ebf ).Due  to  a  lack  of  other  publicly-available  information,  further  investigation  is  necessary  to  ascertain  theveracity  of  360  News  Network\u2019s  uncorroborated  claims.  To  the  extent  that  the  claims  are  accurate,however, Chen\u2019s extramarital affair might pose adverse reputational challenges to CRH and CR Groupgiven the Chinese government\u2019s tough stance on \u2018moral corruption\u2019. In fact, China\u2019s CCDI announced inJune 2014 that officials and civil servants who commit \u2018adultery\u2019 could be removed from their positions andthe Chinese Communist Party, according to a July 2014  article  by The Washington Post.Wenmin DuPublicly-available  information  indicates that Du was born in September 1963 and holds an MBA from theUniversity  of  San  Francisco.

According to the announcement, the project ofwork in two villages and includes a hotel, kindergarten, welfare house, hospital and other publicfacilities.Share AcquisitionsInformation from CRH\u2019s corporate website and other publicly-available sources indicate that CRH and CRGroup have completed the following share acquisitions:In July 2016, CR Group and Australian diversified financial services company  Macquarie Capitalannounced  that they had signed an agreement to acquire up to a 74% stake in  GenesisCare , thelargest  cancer  and  heart  disease  treatment  service  provider  in  Australia.  According  to  theannouncement,  CR  Group  will  facilitate  GenesisCare\u2019s  expansion  in  the  Chinese  market.Australia\u2019s Foreign Investment Review Board  approved  the acquisition in October 2016, with CRgroup and Macquarie Capital eventually acquiring a 56% stake in GenesisCare for AUD 1.7 billion(USD 1.2 billion).In December 2017, mainstream multilingual business news outlet Caixin ( \u8d22 \u65b0 )  reported  that a CRGroup consortium consisting of  China Resources Power Holdings Co Ltd  ( \u83ef\u6f64\u96fb\u529b\u63a7\u80a1\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8 )and two other CR Group subsidiaries had agreed to acquire a 30% stake in the 402 megawatt-capacity Dudegon wind farm located off the coast of Norfolk in the United Kingdom. Particularly,Caixin noted that the consortium had acquired the stake from Stratkraft UK Ltd, the UK subsidiaryof Norwegian power producer Stratkraft, for USD 802.4 million, and that the deal was still subject toapproval  from  Chinese  and  German  regulators.  Datarama  notes  that  there  has  been  no  otherublic  updates  on  whether  CR  Group  has  received  the  necessary  regulatory  approvals  as  atSeptember 2018.",
    "17": "Publicly-available  information  indicates  that  CRH,  CR  Group  and  several  of  its  senior  executives  havebeen involved in reputational issues of concern including corruption and graft. From 2016 to 2017, theconglomerate was also involved in a high profile corporate tussle over the ownership of Chinese propertydeveloper  China Vanke Co Ltd  ( \u4e07\u79d1\u4f01 \u4e1a \u80a1\u4efd\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8 ).Corruption and Graft InvestigationsExtensive public domain research indicates that China\u2019s CCDI has placed at least nine senior CR Groupexecutives under  investigations  for corruption and graft since early 2014. The most prominent of the sevenis former CRH and CR Group chairman  Lin Song  ( \u5b8b\u6797 , \u2018Song\u2019), also known as Charley Song.Publicly-available information indicates that Song first became the target of corruption allegations in July2013  when  Wenzhi  Wang  ( \u738b\u6587\u5fd7 ,  \u2018Wang\u2019),  a  reporter  from  Chinese-language  economic  newspaperEconomic  Information  Daily  ( \u7ecf\u6d4e\u53c2 \u8003 \u62a5 ),  used  his  personal   microblog   to  accuse  the  management  ofChina Resources Power Holdings Co Ltd  ( \u83ef\u6f64\u96fb\u529b\u63a7\u80a1\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8 , \u2018CR Power\u2019), including Song, of severemismanagement and corruption which resulted in a significant loss of public funds.Particularly, Wang  reported  that, in February 2010, CR Power had acquired coal mining assets in Shanxirovince  from  privately-owned   Shanxi  Jinye  Coal  and  Coking  Group   ( \u5c71\u897f\u91d1 \u4e1a \u96c6 \u56e2 )  for  CNY  8  billion(USD 1.16 billion), which was about CNY 5 billion (USD 727.84 million) more than a competing bid fromstate-owned  coal  mining  company   Datong  Coal  Mining  Group   ( \u5927\u540c\u7164 \u77ff \u96c6 \u56e2 \u516c\u53f8 ).  Wang  furtherhighlighted several problems with the assets that CR Power acquired. For instance, one supposed coalmine was in fact an undeveloped farmland that was used by local farmers as a grazing ground.Datarama notes, however, that no punitive action was taken against Song until Wang wrote another  reportin April 2014 accusing Song of having an extramarital affair with a woman named  Lijuan Yang  ( \u6768\u4e3d \u5a1f ),also known as  Helen  Yang. He also stated that Song had exploited CR Group\u2019s working relationship withSwiss bank  UBS Group  to help Yang gain employment at its Hong Kong and Shanghai branches. Moresignificantly, Wang further noted that Yang had assisted Song to conduct illicit activities including briberyand money laundering. Particularly, he highlighted that Yang and her family members had held over CNY 1billion (USD 145.57 million) worth of cash, stocks and high-end properties spread across mainland Chinaand Hong Kong. According to Wang, these assets were likely held on Song\u2019s behalf.  Following the publishing of the April 2014 report, China\u2019s CCDI  announced  that it had placed Song underinvestigation for serious violations of discipline and law\u2019 ( \u4e25 \u91cd \u8fdd\u7eaa\u8fdd \u6cd5 ), a euphemism commonly used inreference  to  corruption  and  graft.  The  Chinese  Communist  Party  also   removed   him  as  CRH  and  CRGroup\u2019s  chairman  a  week  after  investigations  commenced,  and  installed   Yuning  Fu   ( \u5085\u80b2\u5b81 )  as  theconglomerate\u2019s new chairman. According to an April 2014  report  by South China Morning Post, Fu wasinstalled due to his reputation as an \u2018experienced manager who has Beijing\u2019s trust\u2019. His position as an\u2018outsider\u2019 to CR Group also meant that he carried no baggage that could hinder necessary reforms in theconglomerate.After being held for over two years without charge, Song was charged in late 2016 for abusing his positionat CR Group between 2004 and 2013 to make CNY 9.74 million (USD 1.41 million) in illicit gains. He wasalso accused of accepting more than CNY 23 million (USD 3.34 million) in bribes between 2005 and 2012in  return  for  promotions  and  project  approvals.  Song  eventually   pleaded   guilty  to  charges  in  February2017, and was  sentenced  to 14 years in prison as well as fined CNY 4 million (USD 582,270) in June2017. In May 2018, the Hong Kong government also  stripped  Song of his honorary title as a \u2018Justice ofPeace\u2019 ( \u592a\u5e73 \u7ec5 \u58eb ), a civic honour which is given to individuals who have made significant contributions toHong Kong society. Datarama notes that Hong Kong\u2019s Independent Commission Against Corruption ( \u5ec9\u653f\u516c\u7f72 ) had also previously  removed   Song  as  chairman  of  its  ethics  development  advisory  committee  inApril 2014.Datarama notes that several independent and anti-establishment media  sources  including Epoch Timesand New Tang Dynasty Television ( \u65b0\u5510\u4eba\u96fb\u8996\u81fa , \u2018NTDTV\u2019) have described Song as a \u2018trusted aide\u2019 ( \u4eb2 \u4fe1 )of  Qinghong Zeng  ( \u66fe \u6df8 \u7ea2 ), China\u2019s former vice president from March 2003 to March 2008. In fact, NTDTVreported  in September 2014 that Zeng had used his personal influence to delay official investigations onSong, and that the latter had pleaded with the former for assistance before his detainment. Due to a lackof  other  publicly-available  information,  further  investigation  is  necessary  to  ascertain  the  veracity  ofNTDTV\u2019s  uncorroborated  claims.  Datarama  cautions,  however,  that  there  are   reports   that  CRH\u2019sincumbent Chief Financial Officer  Ruge Li  ( \u674e\u6c5d\u9769 ) also maintains extended personal connections to Zengvia his personal relationship with  Zhenya Liu  ( \u5218 \u632f \u4e9a , \u2018Liu\u2019), the former chairman of Chinese state-ownedelectric utility company  State Grid Corporation of China  ( \u56fd \u5bb6 \u7535 \u7f51\u516c\u53f8 ) from May 2013 to May 2016 (see\u2018Ownership Structure and Management\u2019 section above). To the extent that the above-mentioned claims areaccurate,  CR  Group\u2019s  lingering  connection  to  Zeng  might  pose  significant  operational  and  reputationalchallenges  amid   rumours   that  Zeng  has  been  placed  under  house  arrest  amid  China\u2019s  ongoing  anti-corruption campaign.Along  with  Song,  at  least  eight  other  former  senior  CR  Group  executives  were  also  placed  underinvestigation for illicit activities. Details of these investigations are as follows:",
    "18": "While  the  above-mentioned  corruption  and  graft  investigations  might  now  be  less  significant  from  anoperational point of view, Datarama notes that it is likely that they continue to have a negative effect on CRGroup\u2019s reputation as they received significant media attention. Further enquiries, therefore, are necessaryto determine the extent to which CR Group has managed to rehabilitate its public image and implementoperational reforms to combat corruption.Management ReshufflesExtensive public domain research identified several significant personnel changes in CRH and CR Groupsubsidiaries since the conclusion of the major corruption and graft investigations mentioned above. Forinstance, healthcare and medical services provider  China Resources Medical Holdings Co Ltd  ( \u83ef\u6f64\u91ab\u7642\u63a7\u80a1\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8 ,  \u2018CR  Medical\u2019)  completed  a  major   management  reshuffle   in  August  2018  as  part  ofreparatory measures for \u2018future expansion\u2019. Datarama notes that the reshuffle was CR Medical\u2019s secondmajor personnel change in recent years, with the company previously  changing  its  senior  managementteam in November 2016. In September 2018, CRH\u2019s vice chairman and general manager  Xi Luo  ( \u7f57 \u71b9 )was   replaced   by   Fuli  Fu   ( \u674e\u798f\u5229 ).  Luo  was  later   appointed   as  chairman  Chinese  insurance  companyChina Taiping Insurance Holdings  ( \u4e2d \u56fd \u592a\u5e73\u4fdd \u9669 \u63a7\u80a1\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8 ).Apart  from  these  recent  personnel  changes,  extensive  public  domain  research  indicates  that  other  CRGroup subsidiaries had also implemented significant management changes in the last three years. Forinstance,   China  Resources  Beer  (Holdings)  Co  Ltd   ( \u83ef\u6f64\u5564\u9152\uff08\u63a7\u80a1\uff09\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8 )   reshuffled   its  seniormanagement team in April 2016. The general manager and vice general manager of Shenzhen-basedinvestment company  China Resources SZITIC Trust Co Ltd  ( \u534e\u6da6 \u6df1 \u56fd \u6295\u4fe1\u6258\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8 ), Qiang Lu ( \u8def \u5f3a )and Jie Tian ( \u7530\u6d01 ), also  left  the company in mid 2016 and late 2015, respectively.Datarama has not identified any indications that the above mentioned personnel changes are non-routine,abnormal, or directly related to the major corruption investigations from 2013 to 2016 that implicated Songand  eight  other  senior  CR  Group  executives.  Nevertheless,  the  recent  management  shuffles  mightotentially signal, or even result in organisational instability within CR Group that warrants closer scrutiny.Corporate Ownership Tussle with VankeFrom  2016  to  2017,  CR  Group  was  involved  in  a  high  profile  corporate  tussle  over  the  ownership  ofChinese property developer  China Vanke Co Ltd  ( \u4e07\u79d1\u4f01 \u4e1a \u80a1\u4efd\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8 , \u2018China Vanke\u2019). Particularly, CRGroup was  accused  of cooperating with Chinese property and financial services conglomerate  BaonengGroup  ( \u5b9d \u80fd\u96c6 \u56e2 ), which had attempted to conduct a  hostile takeover  of China Vanke.The accusation against CR Group arose in June 2016 after it  opposed  China Vanke\u2019s proposal to offershares  to  Chinese  rail  transportation  company   Shenzhen  Metro  Group   ( \u6df1\u5733\u5e02\u5730 \u94c1 \u96c6 \u56e2 \u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8 ).Datarama  notes  that  CR  Group  was  China  Vanke\u2019s  second  largest  shareholder  at  that  time,  whileBaoneng Group was the largest. The deal, estimated to be worth CNY 45.6 billion (USD 6.63 billion) atthat time, would have made Shenzhen Metro Group the largest shareholder of China Vanke, and moresignificantly, blocked Baoneng Group\u2019s hostile takeover attempt. According to a July 2016  article  by SouthChina  Morning  Post,  CR  Group  had  opposed  the  deal  as  it  held  doubts  about  whether  China  Vanke\u2019smanagement  was  \u2018fairly  representing  shareholders\u2019  interests\u2019.  CR  Group  also  denied  cooperating  withBaoneng Group and claimed that China Vanke had been taken over by \u2018insider control\u2019, a term used todescribe a situation whereby controlling rights in a company are seized by management based on theirown personal interests. The deal was eventually cancelled in December 2016.In January 2017, CR Group  sold  its 15.31% stake in China Vanke to Shenzhen Metro Group for CNY 37.2billion (USD 5.40 billion), thereby ending its involvement in China Vanke\u2019s ownership tussle. According tomarket watchers, CR Group\u2019s stake in China Vanke was previously acquired under the leadership of Song,and the conglomerate\u2019s decision to divest potentially signals a change in its new commercial portfolio. InJune 2017, Shenzhen Metro Group  acquired  another 14% stake in China Vanke from Chinese propertycompany  China Evergrande Group  ( \u6046\u5927\u5730\u7522\u96c6\u5718\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8 ) for CNY 29.2 billion (USD 4.3 billion), makingit China Vanke\u2019s largest shareholder, and effectively ending Baoneng Group\u2019s attempt to wrest control.Datarama  notes  that  CR  Group\u2019s  involvement  in  China  Vanke\u2019s  ownership  tussle,  as  well  as  itsrelationship with Baoneng Group received significant media attention. Particularly, several media  outletsincluding Chinese online newspaper The Paper ( \u6f8e\u6e43\u65b0 \u95fb ) speculated on their relationship after news thatBaoneng Group had plans to nominate  Xiangdong Wu  ( \u5434 \u5411 \u4e1c ), the then-chairman of  China ResourcesLand   ( \u83ef\u6f64\u7f6e\u5730\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8 ),  as  China  Vanke\u2019s  new  chairman  following  the  completion  of  the  attemptedtakeover. Datarama also identified uncorroborated claims on online Chinese  forums  such as Guba ( \u80a1\u5427 )that Wu is \u2018close acquaintances\u2019 ( \u94c1 \u54e5 ) with Baoneng Group\u2019s chairman  Zhenhua Yao   ( \u59da\u632f \u534e ).  Theseclaims warrant further scrutiny as the China Insurance Regulatory Commission ( \u4e2d \u56fd \u4fdd \u9669\u76d1 \u7763\u7ba1\u7406\u59d4 \u5458\u4f1a ),in February 2017,  barred  Yao from working in mainland China\u2019s insurance industry for 10 years after itdiscovered that a Baoneng group subsidiary had provided \u2018fake materials\u2019 and \u2018violated rules for using aninsurance fund\u2019. As mentioned previously, Wu was also  investigated  for corruption and graft in late 2014(see \u2018Corruption and Graft Investigations\u2019 subsection above). Further investigation, therefore, is necessaryto ascertain the nature of the relationship between Wu and Yao, and whether CR Group\u2019s alleged ties withBaoneng Group might pose any adverse challenges to its reputation or operations.",
    "19": "Publicly-available information indicates that CRH maintains strong political connections and commercialconnections with other prominent Chinese companies.Political ConnectionsExtensive public domain research indicates that CRH is politically well-connected due to its status as a keystate-owned enterprise. Checks against privately run risk-and-compliance databases indicate that most ofthe  company\u2019s  senior  executives  are  identified  as  politically  exposed  persons  (see  \u2018Company  Checks\u2019section below).Publicly-available  information  also  indicates  that  CRH  and  CR  Group\u2019s  chairman   Yuning  Fu   ( \u5085\u80b2\u5b81 )enjoys good political standing. An April 2014  article  by South China Morning Post, for instance, describedFu  as  an  \u2018experienced  manager  who  has  Beijing\u2019s  trust\u2019.  Fu  is  also  publicly-known  for  his  patriotism.According to a separate July 2016  article  by South China Morning Post, Fu had reportedly turned down awell-paying position at the Singapore Institute of Standards and Industrial Research in 1989 in order to\u2018help\u2019 stabilise China amid political unrest following the Tiananmen Square protests that year.Datarama notes that Fu has leveraged his extensive political connections and positive standing for CRHand CR Group\u2019s benefit. For instance, information from an October 2014  article  by Reuters indicate that,within  six  months  of  his  appointment  as  CRH  and  CR  Group\u2019s  chairman,  Fu  had  visited  at  least  10rovincial  governments  in  a  charm  offensive  to  rehabilitate  the  conglomerate\u2019s  image  and  accumulateolitical capital.Significant Commercial ConnectionsExtensive  public  domain  research  indicates  that  CRH  is  commercially  well-connected.  Particularly,  thecompany has signed cooperation agreements with large state-owned aerospace and defense enterprisessuch as  Aviation  Industry  Corporation  of  China  ( \u4e2d \u56fd \u822a\u7a7a\u5de5 \u4e1a \u96c6 \u56e2 \u516c\u53f8 )  and   China  Aerospace  Scienceand  Technology  Corporation   ( \u4e2d \u56fd \u822a\u5929\u79d1\u6280\u96c6 \u56e2 \u516c\u53f8 ),  as  well  as  other  prominent  companies  such  asmultinational  conglomerate   Tencent  Holdings   ( \u817e\u8baf \u63a7\u80a1\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8 )  and  insurance  firm   China  TaipingInsurance Holdings  ( \u4e2d \u56fd \u592a\u5e73\u4fdd \u9669 \u63a7\u80a1\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8 ) (see \u2018Recent Commercial Activities\u2019 section above).Beyond mainland China and Hong Kong, CRH also maintains a strategic alliance with Japanese food andbeverages conglomerate  Kirin Holdings  ( \u30ad\u30ea\u30f3\u30db \u30fc \u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30b9 \u682a\u5f0f \u4f1a \u793e ). It has also acquired stakes inGenesisCare ,  the  largest  cancer  and  heart  disease  treatment  service  provider  in  Australia,  andcollaborated with Belgian private equity fund  Verlinvest  to  establish   China Resources  Verlinvest  HealthInvestment  ( \u534e\u6da6\u7ef4 \u9e9f\u5065\u5eb7\u6295 \u8d44 \u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8 ), a health and consumer products and services provider.Significant Personal or Familial ConnectionsExtensive public domain  research  indicates that CRH\u2019s chief financial officer  Ruge Li  ( \u674e\u6c5d\u9769 ) allegedlyholds a close relationship with  Zhenya Liu   ( \u5218 \u632f \u4e9a ),  the  former  chairman  of  state-owned  electric  utilitycompany  State Grid Corporation of China  ( \u56fd \u5bb6 \u7535 \u7f51\u516c\u53f8 ) from May 2013 to May 2016. This connection isotentially  problematic  as  Liu  was  the  target  of  a  state-led   accountability  audit   in  May  2014  followingaccusations  of  financial  mismanagement  and  corruption.  Liu  is  also   reportedly   a  proteg\u00e9  of   QinghongZeng  ( \u66fe \u6df8 \u7ea2 ), China\u2019s former vice president who has reportedly been placed under investigations andhouse arrest amid China\u2019s ongoing anti-corruption campaign (see \u2018Ownership Structure and Management\u2019section above).Datarama  also  identified  an  unverified   report   that  CRH\u2019s  vice  general  manager   Lang  Chen   ( \u9648 \u6717 )  isinvolved  in  an  extramarital  affair  with  an  unidentified  woman  surnamed  \u2018Wu\u2019  ( \u6b66 ).  This  connection  isotentially problematic amid the Chinese government\u2019s  tough stance  on \u2018adultery\u2019 and \u2018moral corruption\u2019 ofits officials and public servants.",

The case concerned a shareholding  dispute  in CRH\u2019s subsidiary,Hong Kong construction company Max Share Ltd. Particularly, Ng and another individual Bing-wing Choyhad sought to wind up Max Share, which in turn required CRH to purchase their shares in the company.The petition was eventually rejected by CRH, which maintained that the petitioners had no standing tomake the petition. Datarama notes that there is no indication that the case received any significant mediaattention or presents any notable reputational issues of concern for CRH.Undeclared Offshore InterestsA check against the Offshore Leaks Database maintained by the International Consortium of InvestigativeJournalists indicates that CRH and its principals do not have undeclared interests in offshore jurisdictions.Datarama notes that these checks might not be comprehensive.Last Updated in October 2018This company was checked against lists from sanctioning bodies, law enforcement agencies  and  financial  regulators  worldwide.  The  company  was  not  found mentioned in the records of any lists.
